Petri Net Editor

The Petri Net Editor provides a tool for the user the create basic Place/Transition Nets.  These nets can then be manually executed via the 'Fire Transition' button, or automatically executed via the 'Simulation' button.  Simulations will fire random transitions by default until the requested number of firings is completed or a dead state is reached.  If priorities are enabled, simulations will randomly fire any enabled transition with the highest priority setting.
